### Abstract
The human gut microbiome develops over early childhood and aids in food digestion and immunomodulation, but the mechanisms driving its development remain elusive. Here we use data curated from literature and online repositories to examine trait-based patterns of gut microbiome succession in 56 infants over their first three years of life. We also develop a new phylogeny-based approach of inferring trait values that can extend readily to other microbial systems and questions. Trait-based patterns suggest that infant gut succession begins with a functionally variable cohort of taxa, adept at proliferating rapidly within hosts, which gradually matures into a more functionally uniform cohort of taxa adapted to thrive in the anoxic gut and disperse between anoxic patches as oxygen-tolerant spores. Trait-based composition stabilizes after the first year, while taxonomic turnover continues unabated, suggesting functional redundancy in the traits examined. Trait-based approaches powerfully complement taxonomy-based approaches to understanding the mechanisms of microbial community assembly and succession.
